<p>PLEASE READ THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND TERMS OF SERVICE (THE “AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL AND/OR USE THE SOFTWARE OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>

<p>This agreement (the “Agreement”) is made between Axonix Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales under number 08953245 with its registered address at 260 Bath Road, Slough SL1 4DX (“Axonix”) and you, the mobile application developer or publisher (“Publisher”). </p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h2 id="background">BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Axonix operates a mobile advertising exchange platform (“Ad Exchange”) and operates proprietary technology which allows advertisers (“Advertisers”) to place advertisements (“Advertisements”) on mobile applications and mobile websites.  The purpose of this Agreement is to license the Publisher to use certain proprietary technology in its own applications and websites (“Applications”) in order to provide advertisements from users of the Axonix Ad Exchange to end users of those Applications (“End Users”) (the “Permitted Purpose”) on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="1-software-and-services">1. Software and Services.</h2>

<p>(a) For the purpose of this Agreement, the Axonix Mobile Library (“Software”) is defined as the compiled code and/or source code version of the licensed computer software program(s) downloaded, used, and/or installed pursuant to this Agreement and, if Axonix provides such with the Software, the published and generally available user manuals and documentation, which is designed to allow Publisher to use the services of the abovementioned Ad Exchange to display Advertisements (the “Services”).</p>

<p>(b) Publisher agrees to ensure that its use of the Software will be strictly compatible with the Permitted Purpose only, and will not violate any third party agreements between Publisher and any platform or other service or contract, including those relating to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store (and associated developer and publisher agreements).   </p>

<p>(c) Publisher acknowledges that the Software transmits unique identifiers of the End User device to Axonix.  Publisher shall comply with all privacy and data protection requirements in each territory into which it distributes its Applications, and undertakes to ensure that it has properly informed its End Users of the activity contemplated by this Agreement.  Without limitation to the previous sentence: Publisher agrees to make a privacy policy available to its End Users which contains (i) a statement that Publisher’s Application uses Axonix for advertising, and (ii) a clear link to the Axonix Privacy Policy made available on the Axonix website from time to time.</p>

<h2 id="2-licence-and-restricted-content">2. Licence and Restricted Content</h2>

<p>“Impression Manipulation” means any practice designed and intended to artificially inflate the number of Impressions (for example “forced visit” traffic or spyware/adware loading pages as popups or popunders which load Advertisements, invisible or nested invisible IFRAMEs loading pages which load Advertisements, spyware/adware loading Advertisements invisibly or cause false clicks thereon, or the automatic intentional reloading/refreshing of any code with the intention to make multiple Impressions be registered in short succession.</p>

<p>“Restricted Content” means any content that:  <br>
(i)        is illegal or otherwise not permitted under applicable law or regulation; <br>
(ii)        promotes or is related to illegal activities (illegal drugs, phishing, terrorism, criminal activities, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters);  <br>
(iii)        promotes or is related to tobacco, gambling or weapons;  <br>
(iv)        is related to pornographic or obscene material;  <br>
(v)        is related to excessively graphic or explicit violence;  <br>
(vi)        is defamatory, inappropriate or profane;  <br>
(vii)        is discriminatory or constitute “hate speech”, whether directed at an individual or a group, and whether based upon the race, sex, creed, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation or language of such individual or group;  <br>
(viii)        promotes or contains viruses, worms, corrupted files, cracks or other materials that are intended to or may damage or render inoperable any software or hardware security measures; or <br>
(ix)        interferes with (including by interfering with the memory of), corrupts, manipulates or otherwise alters an End User’s device (including by storing any unauthorised hidden or tracking file on such device).</p>

<p>(a) Axonix grants Publisher a non-exclusive and non-transferable licence until terminated upon written notice by Axonix (the “Term”) to use the Software and to distribute the Software solely as part of its Applications, provided strictly that its Applications do not contain Restricted Content or are not published for a purpose that would contravene applicable law or regulation or generally acceptable honest and legitimate business practices (at Axonix’s sole discretion).</p>

<p>(b) Publisher hereby warrants and represents that (i) it will not allow or permit, or in any way engage in Impression Manipulation, and (ii) Applications will not contain Restricted Content.  Without prejudice to the foregoing, Publisher undertakes to implement and use industry best practice policies and procedures to ensure its continued compliance with this Section 2(b) during the Term.</p>

<p>(c) Axonix may change the scope of use restrictions under this Section 2 at any time; it is the Publisher’s responsibility to periodically check for such updates and/or changes to this Agreement, pursuant to Section 6.2 below. </p>

<p>(d) This licence does not entitle Publisher to receive from Axonix any hard-copy documentation, technical support, telephone assistance, or enhancements or updates to the Software. The licence granted by this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the Term. </p>

<h2 id="3-restrictions">3. Restrictions.</h2>

<p>Axonix reserves any and all rights, implied or otherwise, which are not expressly granted to Publisher hereunder, and retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Software. Publisher agrees that it has no right whatsoever to modify the Software or any portion thereof in any manner. Publisher shall not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, adapt, rent, lease, loan, create or prepare derivative works based upon the Software or any part thereof. Publisher may not use the Software as a managed service provider, as an application service provider, to perform consulting or training services for a third party, or in any commercial time share arrangement. Publisher may not resell the Software. Publisher shall not assign the Software to a third party for use in managing Publisher’s environment without the prior written consent of Axonix.</p>

<h2 id="4-assignment">4. Assignment.</h2>

<p>Publisher may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written approval and express consent by Axonix. Any purported assignment or transfer without such written approval and Axonix’s consent shall be null and void.</p>

<h2 id="5-payment-and-taxes">5. Payment and Taxes.</h2>

<p>5.1   Payment for the display of Advertisements will be at the rate agreed between Axonix and the Advertiser less Axonix’s costs, charges and commissions as determined by Axonix from time to time (the “Revenue Share”). Publisher acknowledges that Axonix operates as an Ad Exchange and is therefore reliant on payment by Advertisers to Axonix before Axonix will pay Publisher.  Axonix will use reasonable endeavours to pay Publisher the relevant Advertising Revenue less the Revenue Share within 90 days of receipt of the relevant Ad Revenue from the Advertiser. Axonix does not guarantee that payment by Advertisers will be made.  Accordingly, payment for the display of each Advertisement is strictly subject to and conditional upon the payment of fees for the same Advertisement (“Ad Revenue”) by the relevant Advertisers.  In the event that Axonix does not receive full payment of the Ad Revenue, Axonix shall not be liable to make any corresponding payment to Publisher.  Publisher acknowledges and agrees that Axonix has no liability to pay Publisher in the event that Publisher does not receive the relevant Ad Revenue from the Advertiser.  </p>

<p>5.2  If Axonix is required to pay sales, use, property, value-added or other taxes pursuant to its activities under this Agreement or on Publisher’s use of Software or services, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by Publisher.   </p>

<p>5.3 Publisher (referred to in this paragraph as “the self-billee”) appoints  Axonix (referred to in this paragraph as “the self-biller”) as agent for self-billing only.  The self-biller agrees to issue self-billed invoices for all supplies made to them by the self-billee until the date of 12 months following the Effective Date of this Agreement (“Self-Billing Agreement”).  The continued usage of the Softwar or the Services following expiry of the Self-Billing Agreement shall give rise to successive Self-Billing Agreements (each for a further 12 months) on the same terms as this paragraph. The self-billee agrees to provide to the self-biller upon immediate request, and self-biller agrees to complete self-billed invoices showing, the supplier’s name, address and VAT registration number, as well as all the other details that make up a full VAT invoice. The self-biller agrees to notify self-biller in the event that their VAT registration number changes, and their continued use of the Software or the Services shall be deemed to give rise to a new self-billing agreement on the same terms as this paragraph for the date of 12 months from such notification. The self-biller agrees to inform the self-biller if the issue of self-billed invoices will be outsourced to a third party. The self-billee agrees not to raise sales invoices for the transactions covered by this agreement. The self-billee agrees to notify the self-biller immediately if they change their VAT registration number, stop being VAT registered or sell their business (or part of their business).</p>

<h2 id="6-termination-and-modification">6. Termination and Modification.</h2>

<p>6.1 This Agreement or an individual licence granted hereunder may be terminated (a) at any time at the sole option and at will without notice by Axonix; (b) at any time at the sole option upon written notice to Axonix by Publisher; or (c) by Axonix, if Publisher breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach to Axonix’s reasonable satisfaction within ten (10) days following receipt of Axonix’s notice thereof.
